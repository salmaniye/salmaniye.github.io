          I'm a full-stack developer who loves building web apps that are both
          intuitive and scalable. Iâ€™ve worked with tools like Next.js, React,
          and FastAPI to create everything from secure payment systems to
          AI-powered features. I'm all about finding practical solutions to
          tricky problems and turning ideas into products that people enjoy
          using.

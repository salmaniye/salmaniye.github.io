// When I joined CICON.App as the Technical Lead, our mission was clear: create an innovative platform that would revolutionize shoe repair services using AI.

// ## The Challenge

// We needed to build a system that could:
// - Analyze shoe damage through photos
// - Provide accurate repair cost estimates
// - Handle real-time payments
// - Manage complex repair workflows

// ## Technical Implementation

// We chose Next.js for our frontend, leveraging its powerful features for server-side rendering and API routes. The integration with Stripe ensured secure payment processing, while our custom AI model, built with Python and FastAPI, handled the damage analysis.

// ## Key Learnings

// This project taught me valuable lessons about:
// - Scaling AI solutions in production
// - Managing complex state in React applications
// - Building secure payment systems
// - Leading a technical team effectively`,
